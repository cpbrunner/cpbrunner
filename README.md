### About Me
I am a Mathematics & Computer Science Teacher at Lexington High School in Lexington, Massachusetts. Prior to teaching in Lexington, I taught in private schools in the Boston area and Guayaquil, Ecuador. 

Since 2013, I have also worked with MIT Introduction to Engineering and Science (MITES) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), serving students from across the United States who are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. I teach first and second semester calculus in the MITES Semester and MITES Summer program and serve as an Academic Mentoring Seminar Instructor in the MITES Saturday program.
